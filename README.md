# em

**em** is a trans-hierarchical mind-mapping app for personal sensemaking. Thoughts are represented as a graph (i.e. network) and rendered as a hierarchy of adjacencies.

**em**'s user experience is designed to mirror the properties of the conceptual mind, including focal constraint, contextuality, nonlinearity, and associative connectivity.
