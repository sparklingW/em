# Contributing Guidelines

## Functional Programming

Adhere to the functional programming style, namely no mutations. The linter will mostly enforce this.

- No `let`; use `const`
- No `for` loops; use `map`, `filter`, `reduce`

See existing code if you are unfamiliar with this approach. Support will be offered to those new to this style, but a willingness and effort is required. Do not claim an issue or submit a Pull Request if you are unable or unwilling to adhere to this requirement.

## Code Quality

Here are some code quality requirements:

- Do not use overly vague variable names or extraneous add-ons such as "data"
- Redundancy should be avoided
- Single-use variables should be avoided
- Functions should have have a well-defined purpose
- Architectural patterns should be intuitive
- Comments should be added to anything that requires additional explanation
- Commits should be limited to a small set of coherent changes
- Commit messages should be a succinct and relevant summary
- Pull Requests should contain a reference to the corresponding Issue

All of these requirements entail judgment calls. There is no clear cut rule of what is right and wrong. Good judgment is contextual and based on experience. Preserving code quality is just as much a part of the task as completing requested changes. Please count on critical discussion during code reviews. The stances of "it works" or "it's good enough" or "that's beyond what I was asked to do" will generally not be considered valid objections to these requirements.

## Contribution Delivery

All contributions must be submitted through public pull requests on the repo at https://github.com/cybersemics/em. This is typically done by forking the repo, creating a new branch, making your changes, pushing your branch to your fork, and then opening a Pull Request from the GitHub interface.

## Regressions

Pull Requests that solve the given issue but introduce a regression (that is, break something else in the process) are not considered solutions and will not be accepted. Here is an example of a Pull Request where the contributor believed they had completed the task, despite having introduced a bug that was not there before: https://github.com/cybersemics/em/pull/154. Preserving existing functionality is just as much a part of the task as completing requested changes.

If a regression is discovered after a Pull Request has been merged, you may still have to go back and fix the regression.
